## Lecture outline

- Behavioural Finance
  - Does the behavioural biases of market participants influence asset prices?
  - Do the models we have discussed thus far accurately represent reality?
- Limits to arbitrage
  - Why can’t arbitrageurs take advantage of mispricing?

\

- Reading
  - BKM Ch. 9


## How do investors behave?

- Conventional Finance
  - Risk averse utility maximisers
  - “Rational” investors
  - Incorporate all information into decision making
  - Resources are allocated efficiently
  - Prices are correct - they equal intrinsic value

:::{.fragment}
- Is this correct? Are you a rational investor?
  - Investors are humans (sometimes)
  - Behavioural finance incorporates psychology into economic decision making
  - Systematic psychological biases will not disappear in aggregate
- Do these behavioural factors lead to market inefficiency?
- Are anomalies found in financial markets because people are not rational investors?
:::


## The behavioural critique

- There are two categories of irrationalities

\

1. Investors do not always process information correctly
- Result: Investors have the incorrect probability distribution of future returns

\

2. Even when given the correct probability distribution of returns, investors may make inconsistent or suboptimal decisions
- Result: Investors exhibit behavioural biases


## Errors in information processing

- These errors can lead to investors incorrectly estimating probabilities 
- Limited attention
  - If investors are time-constrained then they may rely on "rules of thumb"
  - Investors may overreact to attention grabbing news
  - Investors may underreact to less prominent information
- Overconfidence
  - Investors overestimate their abilities and the precision of their forecasts
  - For example, active portfolio managers think they can pick winners
  - Females trade less than males and earn higher returns
  - Overconfidence could lead to price overreactions


## Errors in information processing

- Conservatism
  - Investors are slow to update their beliefs and under react to new information
  - Belief perseverance
  - This could lead to underreactions (e.g. post-earnings announcement drift, price momentum)
- Confirmation bias
  - Investors can have a tendency to selectively interpret information that is consistent with the investment view and disregard information that conflicts with their beliefs
- Sample size neglect and representativeness
  - Investors are too quick to infer a pattern or trend from a small sample
  - Investors then extrapolate that pattern into the future
  - In general, people evaluate the probability of an uncertain event by the degree to which the event is representative or similar (in their mind) to the population regardless of past probabilities $\rightarrow$ stereotyping
    - Tech stocks are winners
    - House prices never go down
  - How do people make probability based decisions?
    - Rational investors consider population probabilities


## Behavioural biases

- Behavioural biases result in less than rational decisions, even with perfect information
- Framing: 
  - How the risk is described “risky losses” vs. “risky gains” can affect investor decisions
  - Experimental evidence shows that people prefer risk-free gains (risk averse behaviour) and prefer risky losses (risk seeking behaviour)
  - Loss aversion: people weigh losses more than gains in their decision making
  - Loss aversion suggests that decision making is sensitive to how alternatives are framed


## Do you like to gamble?

- You can choose to participate in one of the two gambles below

\

1. You have been given a gift of $20,000. In addition, you can choose between:
    a. a sure gain of $5,000 or
    b. a 25% chance of a gain of $20,000, or a 75% chance of receiving $0
1. You have been given a gift of $40,000. In addition, you can choose between:
    a. a sure loss of $15,000 or
    b. a 75% chance of a loss of $20,000, or a 25% chance of losing $0

\

- Would you prefer option 1 or option 2?


## Do you like to gamble?

- Let's calculate expected values

\

- Option 1
  - A: $25000
  - B: Expected value of 20000 + 0.25 * 20000 = $25000
- Option 2
  - A: $25000
  - B: Expected value of 40000 – 0.75 * 20000 = $25000


## Behavioural biases

- Mental accounting
  - This form of framing involves investors behaving differently with different investment accounts/stocks (different risk-aversion for different accounts/stocks)
  - The "house money effect"
- Disposition effect
  - It has been documented that investors do not like to sell stocks where the current price is below the purchase price and crystallize a capital loss
- Regret avoidance
  - Investors will blame themselves for poor investment decisions if the decision was unconventional
  - This could make investors less likely to invest in unconventional assets

  
## Limits to arbitrage

- Behavioural biases would not matter if rational arbitrageurs could fully exploit the mistakes of behavioural investors
- Fundamental risk
  - “Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”
  - Intrinsic value and market value may take too long to converge
  - New information may arrive that affects fundamental value that you cannot hedge
- Implementation costs
  - Transactions costs and restrictions on short selling can limit arbitrage activity
- Model risk
  - What if you have a bad model and the market value is actually correct?
  - Your estimate of firm value might be incorrect


## Limits to arbitrage 

- The law of one price states that identical assets should sell for the same price
  - Lamont, O.A., and Thaler, R.H. (2003). ["Anomalies: The Law of One Price in Financial Markets"](https://uow.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61UOW_INST/otb3u8/cdi_unpaywall_primary_10_1257_089533003772034952){target=_blank}, *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, vol. 17(4), pp. 191-202.

- Royal Dutch and Shell merged with cash flows being split 60/40 to shareholders
  - Royal Dutch should sell for 1.5 times Shell

<!-- - Why did prices deviate from parity? Possibly because Royal Dutch was a constituent of the S&P500 so index funds needed to own the Royal Dutch version of the stock (excess demand) -->


## Publication of research and anomalies

- McLean, R. and Pontiff, J. (2016). ["Does Academic Research Destroy Stock Return Predictability?"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12365){target=_blank} *The Journal of Finance*,  vol. 71, pp. 5-32.
  - They examine returns on 97 anomaly trading strategies after they have been published in academic finance journals 
  - The returns to these strategies are 58% lower after the article has been published 
  - Our findings suggest that investors learn about mispricing from academic publications

:::{.fragment}
- Jacobs, H. & Muller S. (2020). ["Anomalies across the globe: Once public, no longer existent?"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X19301618){target=_blank} *Journal of Financial Economics*, vol. 135, pp. 213-230.
  - Study the pre- and post-publication return predictability of 241 cross-sectional anomalies in 39 stock markets
  - Based on more than two million anomaly country-months, they find that the United States is the only country with a reliable post-publication decline in long/short returns
  - Their analysis of return predictors suggests that barriers to arbitrage trading may create segmented markets and that anomalies tend to represent mispricing rather than data mining

## Anomalies and news

- Engelberg, J., McLean, R. D., & Pontiff, J. (2018) ["Anomalies and news"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12718){target=_blank}, *The Journal of Finance*, vol 73(5), pp.1971-2001.
  - Using a sample of 97 stock return anomalies documented in published studies, they find that anomaly returns are 6 times higher on earnings announcement days and 50% higher on corporate news days
  - The effects are similar on both the long and short sides, and they survive adjustments for risk exposure and data mining
  - Anomaly signals predict errors in analysts’ earnings forecasts 
  - Analysts’ forecasts are systematically too low for anomaly-longs and too high for anomaly-shorts
  - Their results support the view that anomaly returns are the result of biased expectations, which are at least partially corrected upon news arrival


## Conclusion

- Behavioural finance takes account of how people behave
- Behavioural finance can help explain anomalies
- Limits to arbitrage can restrict investors from taking advantage of mispricing in financial markets
