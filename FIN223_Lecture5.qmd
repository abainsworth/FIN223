## Are markets efficient?

![](Fama_Shiller.png)


## Determination of prices

- A share’s value is the present value of expected future cash flows:

$$\text{Value of Share} = \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{E(C_t)}{[1+E(R)]^t}$$

- Present value model requires information on:
  - Future cash flows (i.e. dividends or FCF)
  - Risk via the cost of capital
- Market bases expectations on this information
- Prices respond to changes in expectations
- Changes in expectations arise from new information
- Therefore, prices change as new information arrives


## Market efficiency

- In an efficient market, new information is incorporated into prices in an instantaneous and unbiased manner
- There are two components to efficiency:
- Informational efficiency 
  - Reflects speed at which new information in incorporated into prices
- Market rationality
  - New information is correctly incorporated into stock prices
- If markets are efficient investors cannot use information to consistently earn excess returns
- New information is unpredictable
  - If it could be predicted, then the prediction would be part of today’s information
- Stock prices are unpredictable because information is unpredictable

## Market efficiency

- What makes investors want to trade until prices reflect information?
  - Information-gathering is motivated by desire for higher investment returns
  - The marginal return on research activity may be so small that only managers of the largest portfolios will find them worth pursuing
  - In an efficient market, the marginal cost of obtaining and acting on information should not exceed the marginal benefit derived from such actions
  - Inefficiencies that are not economically exploitable can still be consistent with an efficient market
- If markets were inefficient, resources would be systematically misallocated
  - Firm with overvalued securities can raise capital too cheaply
  - Firm with undervalued securities may have to pass up profitable opportunities because cost of capital is too high


## Market efficiency

- Market efficiency does not imply predictability
  - It is actually inefficiency that implies predictability
- Market efficiency does not state that prices are not randomly set
  - Information arrives randomly and therefore prices move randomly
- Large movements in prices can be consistent with efficiency
- Expected returns do not need to equal observed return
- Market efficiency does not say that all investors will perform equally
  - Some investors will win and some investors will lose


## Classes of information
- Weak form 
  - Do current market prices fully reflect information contained in past prices and volume?
- Semi-strong form
  - Do prices incorporate publicly available information? 
  - This information includes financial reports, press releases, stock exchange announcements, capital structure changes and takeover announcements
- Strong form
  - Does the possession of private information leads to excess returns?
  - Is insider trading profitable?


## How important is time for investors?

## Anomalies

- What is an anomaly?
  - “Something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected”
  - <http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anomaly>{target="_blank"}
- Schwert’s (2003) finance definition of an anomaly
  - “Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent with maintained theories of asset-pricing behavior”
- Anomalies are about predicting future returns using a signal


## Calculating anomaly returns {auto-animate=true auto-animate-easing="ease-in-out"}

- Each stock has a value for the various characteristic measures (e.g. trading volume, market capitalisation, book-to-market ratio, ROE, P/E, etc...)
- Use the signal based on a particular stock characteristic to rank stocks into portfolios
- Let’s use market cap (size) based on the end-of-year market cap (31 Dec 2024)

Large Cap

\

- We can calculate the return of each portfolio for each month after we have ranked the stocks (i.e. Jan 2025, Feb 2025, etc)
- The difference between the returns on the extreme portfolios is the premium, or the return on the anomaly
  - In this case buy the small cap portfolio and short-sell the large-cap portfolio

$$ \text{Anomaly Return}_t = R_{Small, t} - R_{Large, t}$$


## The joint test problem

- Any test of market efficiency necessarily compares returns against some benchmark model
- A benchmark for the expected return is required before we can measure excess returns
  - One possible benchmark is a formal asset pricing model, such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
- Hence, to define excess returns in order to test market efficiency, a model for expected return is first required
- Thus, any test of market efficiency is inherently a joint test of market efficiency and the model of expected return


## Selected anomaly strategies

- **Price momentum**: purchase stocks with the highest returns over the past 12 months and to short-sell stocks with the lowest returns over the past 12 months ([Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2328882){target="_blank"})
- **Size effect**: take a long positions in a portfolio of small firms and short positions in a portfolio of large firms ([Banz (1981)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(81)90018-0){target="_blank"})
  - The relationship between firm size and abnormal returns is not linear 
  - The size effect is concentrated in the smallest decile of firms
  - Half of the size premium occurs in January and is concentrated in the first five trading days of the new calendar year
- **Value effect**: Value shares outperform growth shares ([Fama and French (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04398.x){target="_blank"})
  - Growth shares have low book-to-market ratios while value shares have high book-to-market ratios 
- **Profitability premium**: Firms with high profitability outperform firms with low profitability ([Novy-Marx (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X13000044){target="_blank"})

## Event studies

- Abnormal returns are the difference between actual returns and expected returns
  - Abnormal returns are risk-adjusted returns
  - We can sum up abnormal returns over time to measure cumulative abnormal returns (CARs)
- If we were using the CAPM as our asset pricing model then expected returns would be related to a firm’s beta and the actual market risk premium
- The study of abnormal returns around announcements or particular events are called event studies


## Estimating abnormal returns

- Use the CAPM (single-index model) and historical data to estimate the stock's $\alpha$ and $\beta$
  - You could use monthly returns over a 36 to 60 month window or daily returns over a 30 to 252 day window

$$R_{it}-R_{ft} = \alpha_i + \beta_i(R_{mt}-R_{ft}) + \varepsilon _{it}$$

:::{.fragment}
- Collect $\hat{\beta_i}$ and $\hat{\alpha_i}$
- Use actual market return and risk-free return, combined with estimates of $\hat{\beta_i}$ and $\hat{\alpha_i}$ to calculate what you would expect returns to have been for the stock

$$E(R_{i,Jan2025}) = R_{f,Jan2025} = \hat{\alpha_i} + \hat{\beta_i}(R_{m,Jan2025}-R_{f,Jan2025})$$

:::

:::{.fragment}
- Then you can calculate the abnormal return for stock $i$

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Abnormal Return} &= \text{Actual Return} - \text{Expected Return}\\[3px]
AR_{i,Jan2025} &= R_{i,Jan2025} - E(R_{i,Jan2025})
\end{align}
$$

  - This tests the semi-strong form of EMH
- Information announcements
  - Takeovers
- Accounting information 
  - Earnings announcements
  - Components of earnings
  - Dividend information
  - Post-earnings announcement drift

## Post-earnings announcement drift

- We can examine standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) around earnings announcements
  - Category 10 is the highest positive earnings surprise 
  - Category 1 is the most negative earnings surprise

## Post-earnings announcement drift

- What would we expect to see in an efficient market?

<!-- hand draw image -->


## Conclusion 

- Prices react in an instantaneous and unbiased manner to the arrival of new information in an efficient market
- We can use event studies to identify how prices react
- Are the returns from anomaly strategies really anomalous
  - Are they the result of data mining?
  - Are the anomalies compensation for taking on additional risk?
  - Do studies adequately control for all other risk factors and other potential explanations?
