## Financial markets and the economy

- A key motivation for investing is to transfer consumption to the future
  - Reduce current consumption for greater future consumption
  - Use financial securities to store and grow wealth 

- Allocation of risk 
  - Different asset classes have different levels of risk (e.g. debt vs equity)
  - Investors can choose assets that aligns with their risk tolerance

- Informational role of financial markets
  - Capital should flow to companies with the best prospects
  - If so, market prices should reflect this information

## Investment philosophy
:::{}
- Identifies what your fund's basic principles of investing are
- It directs your analysis and the generation of investment ideas
- The investment philosophy avoids your fund making ad hoc investment decisions
:::

<br/>

There are four key components of an investment philosophy:

1. Statement of beliefs about the markets
2. Statement of beliefs about the opportunities to create value
3. Statement of beliefs about the group’s abilities
4. Statement of beliefs about the group’s ability to exploit the opportunities to create value


## Components of investment philosophy

- Statement of beliefs
  - What do you believe about the Australian equity market?
  - Is it efficient? If not, what drives these inefficiencies?
  - This statement can be quite general
  - This statement should be externally focussed

- Statement of opportunities
  -	This follows from the statement of beliefs
  -	What opportunities are available that you can exploit to add value?
  -	This statement is more specific
  -	What are the sources of alpha? 
  -	Diversification, risk management, etc?
  -	This statement should be externally focussed

## Components of investment philosophy

- Statement of ability
  -	What capabilities do you have individually and collectively that will allow you to take advantage of the opportunities to add value?
  -	Do you have a competitive advantage?
  -	This statement should be internally focussed

- Statement of value
  -	Can be separate or incorporated into the Statement of Ability
  -	What is the expected benefit of the investment approach?
  -	What do you expect to happen if you follow the investment philosophy?


## Investment process considerations

  - Are there specific return requirements?
  - What is the risk tolerance of the investors in your fund?

  - What is the eligible investment universe? 
  - What are the liquidity needs of investors?
  - How long is the investment horizon of the fund?
  - Are there unique needs of investors
    - Are any screens applied (e.g. socially responsible investing)?
- Methods
  -	What methods are you going to use to construct the portfolio and choose the portfolio weights?
  -	How is rebalancing undertaken?
  - Will you use a top-down or bottom-up approach or some combination of the two?
