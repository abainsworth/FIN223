<h2>Investor decision making</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If there is no uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Then we only need to determine how much we want to consume now, and how much we want to consume later</li>
<li>Investors can invest in the risk-free asset to transfer current wealth to the future</li>
</ul></li>
<li>But returns are not certain across all possible states of the world
<ul>
<li>We need to invest in risky assets</li>

</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>How does an investor choose the amount to invest in risky assets?
<ul>
<li>We need to measure their attitude to risk</li>
<li>Investors can have different levels of risk aversion</li>

<h2>Risk preferences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two investment assets require an initial investment of $100
<ul>
<li>Asset A: 60% chance of making $170 and 40% chance of making $15</li>
<li>Asset B: 60% chance of making $108 and 40% chance of making $108</li>

<li>The risk-premium on the risky investment is zero as <span class="math inline">\(E(R_A)=E(R_B)\)</span></li>

<h2>Risk preferences</h2>

<li>Risk neutral (is indifferent to a fair gamble and a risk-free investment)</li>
<li>Risk seeking (will prefer a fair gamble to a risk-free investment)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The investor’s taste for risk will lead to certain shapes of the utility function</li>
<li>Risk-averse investors require an appropriate risk premium to accept a risky investment</li>
<li>Risk-neutral investors will select the investment with the highest return</li>
<li>Risk seeking investors will pay a premium to take additional risk</li>

<h2>Mean-variance preferences</h2>
<ul>
<li>The mean-variance criterion states that portfolio A is preferable to portfolio B if the two conditions hold with one inequality being strict:</li>

<p><span class="math display">\[E(R_A) \ge E(R_B)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\sigma_A \le \sigma_B\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>This is simply a mathematical statement that investors will choose portfolios which have higher returns and lower risk</li>

<h2>Mean-variance preferences</h2>
<ul>
<li>We can calculate certainty equivalents to rank competing portfolios</li>
<li>What is the risk-free return required to make an investor with A = 3 indifferent to a portfolio with expected return of 15% and standard deviation of 20%?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[U = E(R) - \frac{1}{2} A \sigma^2\]</span> <span class="math display">\[U_{Risky} = 0.15 - \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 0.2^2 = 0.09\]</span></p>

<li>What is the return on the risk-free portfolio that has the same utility</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[U_{Risk-free} = 0.09 = E(R) - \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 0^2 \Rightarrow E(R) = 0.09\]</span></p>

<li>Income-oriented retirement

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>We can use a utility function to model investor preferences</li>
<li>This allows us to combing risk and return into a single equation</li>
<li>Allows us to incorporate different levels of risk aversion (A)</li>
<li>We can use investor utility to help decide what investment portfolio an investor should hold</li>
